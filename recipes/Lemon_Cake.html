    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>
        This soft and moist lemon cake is doubly lemony, 
        thanks to lemon juice and lemon zest, and is soaked in a tangy 
        lemon syrup to further boost the flavor. These cake layers bake 
        up nice and flat, so you don’t even need to worry about trimming 
        them. The cream cheese frosting comes together easily with 
        two simple tricks: Start by blending the powdered sugar with 
        the butter until thoroughly smooth before adding the cream cheese, 
        and be sure to use room-temperature cream cheese so it incorporates 
        easily. (Firm cream cheese can lead to overbeating and liquidy 
        frosting.) Practice your piping skills by using a little bit of 
        the frosting and a star pastry tip to pipe a few rosettes around 
        the border of the cake. If you’d prefer not to pipe, thinly sliced 
        lemons make a lovely garnish all on their own, too.
